# Traffic-sign-detection-for-autonomous-vehicles
**Introduction**
This project implements Traffic Sign Detection using YOLOv8, one of the most advanced object detection models available today. The primary objective is to accurately detect and classify various traffic signs from images or video streams, making it a crucial technology for applications such as:
* Enabling cars to automatically detect and react to traffic signs is known as autonomous driving.
* Traffic monitoring: Assisting law enforcement in effectively assessing and controlling traffic flow.
* Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS): By using AI-powered detection, ITS helps create safer and smarter roads.

In order to control traffic, maintain road safety, and give drivers vital information, traffic signs are important.  However, it might be difficult to manually monitor and analyze them, particularly in dynamic areas like highways or metropolitan streets.  This research uses computer vision and deep learning to automate the procedure and provide very accurate real-time detection.

 A labeled dataset of traffic signs, comprising standard types like warning, prohibitory, stop, and speed restriction signs, is used to train the model.  The model is intended to provide high detection accuracy with minimal latency through extensive training, fine-tuning, and optimizations, which qualifies it for use in practical situations.

This project shows off YOLOv8's powerful and effective object identification features, which enable quick inference on a range of devices, including embedded AI systems, desktop GPUs, and edge devices.  This solution offers a solid basis for traffic sign identification tasks, whether for research, industry applications, or smart city efforts.



## Dataset

The dataset used for training consists of images containing various traffic signs labeled with bounding boxes. The dataset includes:
* 🚏 Speed limit signs
* ⚠️ Warning signs
* ⛔ Prohibitory signs
* 🛑 Stop signs
* 📍 Directional signs
  
####Fairness Aspects 
### 1. Robustness
Goal: To test the model’s ability to maintain accurate and confident predictions under realistic, imperfect input conditions that simulate challenges encountered in real-world environments.

Perturbations Applied:
Brightness Adjustment: Simulates lighting changes (e.g., day/night transitions, glare).
Contrast Variation: Mimics fog, shadow, and exposure inconsistencies.
Rotation: Represents angled camera placement or tilted traffic signs.
Horizontal Flip: Tests symmetry awareness; important when images are mirrored or from reversed views.
Motion Blur: Emulates camera movement or fast-moving vehicles that blur sign visibility.


### 2.Explainability: Visual Bounding Box Overlays
To provide transparency into model decisions, we implemented a Grad-CAM-style heatmap overlay based on the detected bounding boxes.

Process
* Selected a test image from the dataset
* Ran YOLOv8 inference to extract predicted bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores
* Used OpenCV to draw:
* Blue bounding boxes with class labels and confidence
* A transparent red rectangle over each detection to simulate heatmap visualization and then displayed the final annotated image using matplotlib


## Model Architecture

The project uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, Version 8) for object detection, which provides:

* ✅ High-speed inference
* ✅ Optimized deep learning backbone
* ✅ Improved accuracy compared to previous YOLO versions
* ✅ Flexibility for real-time application



## Installation & Setup##

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

bash
```git clone https://github.com/your-repo/traffic-sign-detection-yolov8.git```
```cd traffic-sign-detection-yolov8```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:

#### bash
```pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy matplotlib```
Or install from requirements.txt:

#### bash
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
### 3️⃣ Prepare the Dataset
Download GTSRB Dataset from Kaggle

Use the notebook kaggle_data_to_colab.ipynb to mount and load data into your Colab environment.
### 4️⃣ Train the Model

If you want to train YOLOv8 from scratch or fine-tune on a custom dataset
We trained the model using YOLOV8 BY BUILDING YAML

#### bash
```yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8s.pt data=dataset.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640```
yolov8s.pt – Pretrained YOLOv8 model
dataset.yaml – Path to dataset configuration
epochs=50 – Number of training epochs
imgsz=640 – Image size for training


### 5️⃣ Run Inference
To test the trained model on images:

#### bash
```yolo task=detect mode=predict model=best.pt source=sample_image.jpg```
For real-time detection using a webcam:

#### bash
```yolo task=detect mode=predict model=best.pt source=0```

### 6️⃣ Evaluate Model Robustness
In Final_Trustworthy.ipynb:
Locate the Robustness Evaluation cell block
This runs YOLO on augmented test images using:
* Brightness changes
* Contrast variation
* Rotation
* Horizontal flipping
* Motion blur
The script calculates the Mean, Min, Max Confidence scores
Outputs a summary table and a bar chart of mean confidence under each transformation

### 7️⃣ Run Explainability Visualization
In the same notebook:
Locate the Explainability Visualization section
Replace the image_path variable with a test image path
Run the block to generate a heatmap-style visualization over the detected signs
This helps visually confirm that YOLOv8 is focusing on the correct regions

No additional CLI command is needed — just run the relevant cells inside the notebook.
